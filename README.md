# Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 👋

My name is Gary, and I've just started learning how to code 🌱. To be honest, most of this is new to me, but I've always dreamed of building my own software ✨.

Being unemployed has given me the chance to dive headfirst into this passion 🔥. **I'm pairing my learning with modern AI tools to help me bridge the gaps and bring my ideas to life.** The repositories you see here are my learning journal 📖. They will have bugs 🐛, messy code, and imperfections, but they are created with a genuine desire to learn and share ❤️.

My hope is that something I've built might be useful to you too 😊.

### 🧠 What I'm Up To

-   🌱 **Learning:** I'm teaching myself **everything** from scratch.
-   🛠️ **Building:** I create simple scripts and apps to solve problems I face myself, **often with a help from my AI coding tools.**
-   📈 **Improving:** I plan to revisit and refactor these projects as my skills grow.
